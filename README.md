UTF8Analyzer
============

purpose
=======
- this function will simply return a yes or no in terms of a byte string is UTF-8 compliant.  Now as you know ascii is also UTF-8 compliant.  Thus this readme file should also pass.  However if you have windows document it should fail the UTF-8 test.  However it is possible (although unlikely) that a UTF-32 buffer could be comprised of only ASCII compatible bytes and thus pass.  But then again that is very very unlikely.

I wrote this using "C" because it is the most portable language on earth.  You can use in in C++, Java, Objective-C and of course "C".

I hope you enjoy use and improve.

This code is a BSD like copy write, except you don't need to give me credits to your app.  In other words you can use as you see fit and do not need to give me credit ;-)

I only ask you leave my name in the header file.
